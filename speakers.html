			<p><b>Haluk Öğmen, PhD, University of Denver, USA (Keynote)</b></p>
			<p>Haluk Öğmen obtained B.Sc.A and Ph.D degrees in electrical engineering from Université Laval, Québec, Canada, in 1983 and 1988, respectively. In 1988 he joined the University of Houston, Houston, TX, where he was Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. He also served as the Executive Director of the Center for Neuro-Engineering &
      Cognitive Science at the University of Houston. He spent the 1995–1996 academic year at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, as a Visiting Scientist.
      In 2004, he was a Fellow of the Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg (Hanse Institute for Advanced Study) in Bremen, Germany. He is an Honorary Visiting Professor of Computational Neuroscience,
      at the University of Bradford, Bradford, UK. In 2016, he joined the University of Denver as Senior Associate Dean and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering.
      His research combines visual psychophysics and computational modeling. His areas of expertise include dynamic aspects of vision, visual memory, attention, and consciousness.
      He published ca. 100 papers in mainstream experimental and modeling vision journals. He co-authored Visual Masking: Time Slices Through Conscious and Unconscious Vision
      (Oxford, U.K.: Oxford University Press, 2006) and Experimental Phenomena of Consciousness (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007; recipient of American Library Association
      Choice Outstanding Academic Title Award) and co-edited The First Half Second: The Microgenesis and Temporal Dynamics of Unconscious and Conscious Visual Processes
      (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006). Prof. Ogmen is a member of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS), the Society for Neuroscience (SfN), and the American Association for the
      Advancement of Science (AAAS).</p>

	    <p><b>Aslı Özyürek, PhD, Radboud University and Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Netherlands (Keynote)</b></p>
			<p>Prof. Dr. Asli Ozyurek completed her BA in Psychology at Bogazici University Turkey and earned a double PhD degree in Psychology and Linguistics from University of Chicago. Currently she is a Principle Investigator at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior at Radboud University in Netherlands and is a Research Associate at MaxPlanck Institute for Psycholinguistics and is the Director of the
      Multimodal Language and Cognition lab. In her research she investigates the role our ability to use language plays in cognition and communication. To do so she uses a crosslinguistic and multimodal approach to language and investigates how language is used in embodied and situated contexts through our bodily actions as in the use of gestures and sign languages and how it interacts with other domains of cognition (spatial cognition, action, memory, social intention), that its neural, cognitive and social foundations.  

She is an elected member of Academia Europea and has been ASPASIA award from Dutch Science Foundation and Young Scientist award from Turkish Science Foundation.
She has received many career grants such as ERC Starting Grant, Dutch Science foundation VIDI and VICI grants and hosted many Marie Curie Individual Fellowships and has publications
in Science, PNAS, Cognition, Psychological Science, J of Cognitive Neuroscience, Neuroimage among others. </p>

			<p><b>Luke E. Miller, PhD, Donders Centre for Cognition, Radboud University, Netherlands</b></p>
			<p>Dr. Luke Miller received his PhD in Cognitive Science in 2015 from the University of California, San Diego under the guidance of Ayse P. Saygin. He then spent four years as a
      postdoctoral research fellow in Lyon, France working with Alessandro Farnè. It is there that he developed the research program he will discuss in his talk. He is now a
      senior research fellow in the Sensorimotor Control Group of the Donders Centre for Cognition at Radboud University working with Pieter Medendorp.</p>

			<p><b>Alba Tuninetti, PhD, Bilkent University, Turkey </b></p>
			<p> Dr Alba Tuninetti completed her doctoral training in psycholinguistics at the University of Pittsburgh and in the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition.
      She examined how nonnative speech sounds were perceived and acquired in two learner groups based on their first language typology. She is broadly interested in
      second language learning, bilingualism, and speech perception. Her PhD work examined how similarity to the first language, training, feedback, and cue strength
      influenced the neural and behavioural processing of nonnative (second language) phonemes using EEG and behavioral methods. She is also interested in bilingual speech
      and accent perception (as well as language processing more generally), investigating how the first language influences the second language.</p>
